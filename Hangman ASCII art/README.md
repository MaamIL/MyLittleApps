# Hangman ASCII art

Hangman ASCII art is an exercise I took from campusIL. It is ran in cmd and the visual is ASCII art. <br>

## Running Hangman ASCII art

` python .\FinalGame.py ` <br>

## Code of Hangman ASCII art

Hangman ASCII art code holds 2 code files and 1 additional must-have file: <br>
**FinalGame.py** - holds the code for the game. <br>
**ascii_art.py** - holds the ascii art:<br>
![art1](./imgs/art1.png)<br>
![art2](./imgs/art2.png)<br>
**words.txt** - a file taken from the web, holding thousands of words in english. Hangman chooses a random word from this file.<br>
The Ascii art file holds a dictionary for each art. The main code calls each art according to its situation number. It requires colorama python libraries to show a bit of color in the cmd.<br>

## Playing Hangman ASCII art

Once ran, after the openning ASCII art, you will have the 4 elements that will guide you: <br>
1. word to guess with number of letters in the parentheses followed by underline for each letter.<br>
2. Hangman is the ASCII art of the status you are at (each wrong guess will promote the hanging man art). <br>
3. Tries left is how many times you can error (initialy 6). <br>
4. Letters used is an array of letters you have guessed before to help you not guess the same again.<br>

Now, all you need to do is to guess a letter. The letter you guesed will now be in the Letters used array, and if it is in the word- it will replace the relevant underline or underlines.<br>
If you guess before the man is hang (less than 6 tries)- you win and the man drops free from the hanging pole. If you do not guess the word in time- man stays hanged and you loose.

I did add some error handling for cases where you guess a charachter that isn't a letter / you guess a letter that was used before / you guess more than ine letter in a single guess:
