## Running Tic-Tac-Toe

` python  .\game.py `

## Code of Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe code holds 2 files: <br>
**game.py** - calls the clas 'TicTacToe' and mainloops on an instance of it. <br>
**TicTacToe.py** - holds defaults of game visualizations (size, colors) and the class 'TicTacToe' which holds visualizations and logic of the game. <br><br>
For visualizing the game, I used the 'TKinter' python interface library. 

## Playing Tic-Tac-Toe

The game is played by 2 players. <br>
Once opens, you will be asked to insert names for both players.

There are 3 options for ending the game: X player wins, O player wins or Tie. <br>

<br>
If you choose to play gain- the game will restart while the other player starts (once X player starts, in the next game- O player starts and so on). The winning or tie numbers will be accumulated and shown each time you end a game, untill you'll exit.
