Rock, Paper, Scissors code holds 1 file: <br>
**game.py** - holds defaults of game visualizations (icons) and the logic and prints of the game. <br>
The code is very simple and straight forward. It requires random and time python libraries.

<br>
Now the "processing" animation will run for a few seconds- it is the Rock, Paper, Scissors icons flashing one after the other. Once done, you'll get the results: what yoy chose, what the computer chose and if you win/loose/tie (Teko-Teko).
